# dorothea-py
This is a Python implementation of the package [DoRothEA](https://github.com/saezlab/dorothea) for Transcript Factor activity prediction from transcriptomics data.
In this implementation, DoRothEA is coupled with normalized mean as statistic and uses the [scanpy](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy) framework. 


## Installation
The package can easly be installed using pip
```
pip install git+https://github.com/saezlab/dorothea-py.git
```

## Usage of DoRothEA for commercial purpose
DoRothEA as it stands is intended only for academic use as in contains resources whose licenses don't permit commerical use. However, we developed a non-academic version of DoRothEA by removing those resources (mainly TRED from the curated databases). To access the commercial version run:
```
import dorothea
dorothea.load_regulons(commercial=True)
```

## History
Initially DoRothEA was a framework of **D**iscriminant **R**egulon **E**xpression **A**nalysis, as described in [Garcia-Alonso et al., 2017](https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2017/12/09/0008-5472.CAN-17-1679). At that time DoRothEA was used with a smaller set of regulons to find associations between TF activities and drug responses. Those results are queryable at [Open Targets](https://dorothea.opentargets.io/). Over the past years DoRothEA evolved from the analytical framework to a pure regulon resource as it is now.
